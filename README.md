## Project: Part 1

## Topic: Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Reasoning for Topic Choice:
* As the internet becomes a more integral part of everyday life, we become more and more susceptible to fraudulent acticity, especially credit card fraud. It is not uncommon for an individual to make multiple online transactions weekly, if not daily. These transactions can pose a significant risk to one's personal financial information. As we have seen throughout this course, mining personal data isn't rocket science, so an individual with malicious intent can steal one's personal information without much trouble. As a group, we want to see what factors make one more susceptible to credit card fraud in hopes of better protecting ourselves in the future.

## Dataset Source:
* [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)
* [Average Income by US Zip Codes dataset from Kaggle](https://github.com/justicecodes/projectpractice#dataset-source:~:text=Average%20Income%20by%20US%20Zip%20Codes) 

## Description of Communication Protocols:
* Slack:
  * Daily casual communication in a group Slack channel to report progress of small group meetings and individual questions to collaborate on code
* Zoom:
  * Whole group meetings during class T/Th 7-9pm
  * M/W/Su group zoom meetings 9-10pm, some meetings are whole group, some are small groups within the team to collaborate on certain project segments
management of meeting times is communicated through Slack

## Machine Learning Model:
  * We are using a supervised machine learning model to help determine if a credit card transaction is fraud or not fraud

  * First, we are using feature importance/random forest to see which features are more predictive - age range, m/f

  * Next, we are using a logistic regression model to classify if transactions in the training group are fraud or not fraud. The goal is that the model and accuracy is replicable with the test set.
