# project part 1 

## Topic: Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Questions to answer: 
* Are there factors (gender, age, location, income range, time of day, category of purchase) that make you more susceptible to credit card fraud?

## Dataset source:
[Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) dataset from Kaggle
** Need another csv with at least one column same (zip code // avg income/race/FIPS score for that zip code) 

## Exploratory analysis ideas:


## Machine Learning Model Mockup:
(diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps)
* Fraud or not fraud? By age range
* Linear or logistic regression model

## Database Mockup:
* create folder of csvs 
* columns/ features being used in each dataset
* ERD (how dfs are being joined)
* Week 2 - upload into postgres (eventually join both tables)

## Technologies used:
* Jupyter Notebook - dataframes, machine learning model
* PgAdmin (editing dataset to remove rows/columns)
* Tableau - pie chart of male vs female and category, bar chart of age ranges & income ranges, bar chart of time of day, map of location of card holders

## Roles:
(lead of each role, proposed roles) 
* Machine learning model - 
* SQL / Postgres - 
* Tableau - 
* Jupyter Notebook (summary stats) - 
* Square (github / project manager / slideshow presentation at end) - 

Original roles
* Square (git) - 
* Triangle (machine learning) - 
* Circle (dataset) - 
* X Triangle (technologies used) - 
* X Circle (technologies used) -
