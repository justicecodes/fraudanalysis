# project part 1 

## Topic: Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Questions to answer: 
* Are there factors (gender, age, location, income range, time of day, category of purchase) that make you more susceptible to credit card fraud?

## Dataset source:
[Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) dataset from Kaggle
** Need another csv with at least one column same (zip code // avg income/race/FIPS score for that zip code) 

## Exploratory analysis ideas:


## Machine Learning Model Mockup:
(diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps)
* Our outcome variable will determined by "is_fraud", in which 0= Not Fraud and 1= Fraud? 
* We will use feature importance/random forest to see which features are more predictive: AgeGroup, gender, city_pop, average_income
* logistic regression model

 ✓ Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
 ✓ Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
 ✓ Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
 ✓ Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place
 ✓ Description of current accuracy score

## Database Mockup:
* create folder of csvs 
* columns/ features being used in each dataset*
* ERD (how dfs are being joined)
* Week 2 - upload into postgres (eventually join both tables)

## Technologies used:
* Jupyter Notebook - dataframes, machine learning model
* PgAdmin (editing dataset to remove rows/columns)
* Tableau - pie chart of male vs female and category, bar chart of age ranges & income ranges, bar chart of time of day, map of location of card holders
