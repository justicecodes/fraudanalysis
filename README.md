# project part 1 

## Topic: Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Questions to answer: 
* Are there factors (gender, age, location, income range, time of day, category of purchase) that make you more susceptible to credit card fraud?

## Dataset source:
[Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) dataset from Kaggle
** Need another csv with at least one column same (zip code // avg income/race/FIPS score for that zip code) 

## Exploratory analysis ideas:


## Machine Learning Model Mockup:
(diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps)
* Fraud or not fraud? By age range
* Linear or logistic regression model

## Database Mockup:
* create folder of csvs 
* columns/ features being used in each dataset
* ERD (how dfs are being joined)
* Week 2 - upload into postgres (eventually join both tables)

## Technologies used:
* Jupyter Notebook - dataframes, machine learning model
* PgAdmin (editing dataset to remove rows/columns)
* Tableau - pie chart of male vs female and category, bar chart of age ranges & income ranges, bar chart of time of day, map of location of card holders

## Roles:
* Square (git) - 
* Triangle (machine learning) - 
* Circle (dataset) - 
* X Triangle (technologies used) - 
* X Circle (technologies used) - 


Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”think of a question that can be answered using data.
Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
