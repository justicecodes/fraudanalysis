# Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Presentation Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-1RvOME2adhu_sqhdcV004dQU8e36NeqqYgtGavd53A/edit?usp=sharing

## Questions to answer: 
* Are there factors (gender, age, location, income range, time of day, category of purchase) that make you more susceptible to credit card fraud?

## Reasoning for topic choice: 
* Credit card usage has been increasing steadily over the years, but even moreso with change shortages and COVID in the past few years. 28% of all transactions are with credit cards as of 2021. 80% of American adults have had a credit card account, with an average of 3 cards per person. With the increased usage, credit card fraud is also becomming more prevalent. We agreed that everyone has had to deal with recouperating fraudulent charges or know someone close to them who has.  Our project group is interested in finding out if there are patterns or basic personal information (age, location, time of day) that makes people more susceptible to credit card fraud. The data we are using is limited in that it does not disclose how the credit card was used, for example if the card was physically stolen, entered online through phishing schemes, or any other method. Other uncertainties with results may occur with simulated data fields due to personal privacy laws. Models and results visualized as graphs will focus on personal demographics that may make a person more susceptible to fraud so that our audience may have a better idea how to keep their credit card usage safer overall.

## Dataset source:
* [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) dataset from Kaggle, training csv file is used for analysis
* [Average Income by US Zip Codes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamishgunasekara/average-income-per-zip-code-usa-2018?select=postcode_level_averages.csv) dataset from Kaggle

## Description of Communication Protocols: 
* Slack:
  * Daily casual communication in a group Slack channel to report progress of small group meetings and individual questions to collaborate on code
* Zoom:
  * Whole group meetings during class T/Th 7-9pm
  * M/W/Su group zoom meetings 9-10pm, some meetings are whole group, some are small groups within the team to collaborate on certain project segments
  * management of meeting times is communicated through Slack

## Machine Learning Model:
* We are using a supervised machine learning model to help determine if a credit card transaction is fraud or not fraud
* First, we are using feature importance/random forest to see which features are more predictive - age range, m/f
* Next, we are using a logistic regression model to classify if transactions in the training group are fraud or not fraud. The goal is that the model and accuracy is replicable with the test set.
