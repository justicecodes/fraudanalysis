## Project Part 1
## Topic: Credit Card Fraud Analysis
## Reasoning for topic choice:
* As the internet becomes a more integral part of everyday life, we become more and more susceptible to fraudulent acticity, especially credit card fraud. It is not uncommon for an individual to make multiple online transactions weekly, if not daily. These transactions can pose a significant risk to one's personal financial information. As we have seen throughout this course, mining personal data isn't rocket science, so an individual with malicious intent can steal one's personal information without much trouble. As a group, we want to see what factors make one more susceptible to credit card fraud in hopes of better protecting ourselves in the future.
