# project part 1 

## Topic: Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Questions to answer: 
* Are there factors (gender, age, location, income range, time of day, category of purchase) that make you more susceptible to credit card fraud?

## Reasoning for topic choice: 
* 

## Dataset source:
* [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) dataset from Kaggle, training csv file is used for analysis
* [Average Income by US Zip Codes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamishgunasekara/average-income-per-zip-code-usa-2018?select=postcode_level_averages.csv) dataset from Kaggle


## Machine Learning Model:
* Fraud or not fraud?
* feature importance/random forest to see which features are more predictive - age range, m/f
* logistic regression model
* Provisional model (screenshot?)

  * Description of data preprocessing: 
  * Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including their decision- making process: 
  * Description of how data was split into training and testing sets: 
  * Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits: 
  * Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables): 
  * Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place: 
  * Description of current accuracy score:
